// A PassthroughVisualOutlet is a view which exhibits the behavior that it does not intercept touch events itself, but that its subviews still can. There is no way to enforce the proper behavior of a PassthroughVisualOutlet, so this protocol serves just as an honor system label which indicates to the client that the conforming entity claims to behave this way.
public protocol PassthroughVisualOutlet: VisualOutlet { }
